â€“
o Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content using Python. The project aimed to identify patterns and 
trends in content published by Netflix in the last few years. 

o Gathered the dataset and cleaned the data to ensure it was ready for analysis. I used Python's Pandas library to 
perform exploratory data analysis and gain insights into the dataset.

o Visualized the data using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create interactive visualizations
